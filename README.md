# Overview
This is meant to be C++ implementation of the following Rust tutorial:
https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/third.html

I did this as a means of comparing the two languages, including their test and build systems.
C++ has to be augmented with Conan (package management) and GTest (unit test management) to get the same features as rust.

I am thinking of implementing a red-black tree here, as well as C++ iterators
